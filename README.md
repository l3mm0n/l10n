l10n

Here is my l10n portfolio. You can see each project I've worked on. To see the business files (rather than these tech files) check out http://sarahlemmon.wordpress.com/l10n/.

Project 1 is a website localization project. My team used SDL Trados (yay for free software as a student!) to translate each HTML file. Then I consolidated them and linked them all together with a language picker.

Project 2 is a desktop application project. Paint.exe is used on Windows devices. I used SDL Passolo to translate this executable into Japanese. You can see both files.

Project 3 is an iOS app. It actually has it's own repo. Check out https://github.com/l3mm0n/japaneserubi.
